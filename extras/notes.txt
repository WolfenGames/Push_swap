For 100 < numbers, I find the median and push everything below the median into stack b. - Median does not work with unsorted list!!!
Then I identify each the largest and smallest integer in stack b, 
and determine which is most efficient to rotate up/down and push 
back to stack a (along with the specific moves to make that happen). Then I execute those moves. 

You can find the main in ft_algorithm_d.c
